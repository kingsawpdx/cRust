## Project Description:
cRust is an idle game that will be developed utilizing Rust. The objective of this assignment is to get hands on experience applying advanced concepts of the Rust programming language through the implementation of an interesting project. Due to the time constraint, cRust will be very similar to other modern idle games such as cookie clicker. 

## Project Vision:

### cRust will have the following capabilities:

A player class which manages all data for the user including:
- User name.
- Restaurant name.
- Current sandwiches available.
- Total sandwiches made.

A market that will allow for upgrades and automation. These upgrades will include:
- Sandwich artists
- cRust-Way sandwich shops
- cRust-azon distribution centers
- Possibly more if time allows.

A list of goals of achievements to work towards. These goals will include
- Make 1,000,000 sandwiches
- Produce x amount of sandwiches per second
- Have x amount of sandwich shops/distribution centers.
